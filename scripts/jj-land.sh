# Publish the described jj change: gate exactly it, then push exactly it.
#
# Usage: scripts/jj-land.sh [bookmark] [--dry-run]
#   The bookmark defaults to LAND_BOOKMARK, else `main` if it exists, else `master`.
#
# This is the only publish verb in a jj repository whose gates used to run in
# git hooks: jj runs no hooks, so the gate travels with the publish instead.
# It pins the candidate commit before the gate, runs the gate, checks that
# nothing moved, and only then moves the bookmark to the pinned commit and
# pushes it. It rewrites nothing, so the gated bytes are the published bytes.
# A raw `jj git push` skips the gate; do not use one.
#
# The candidate is `@` when `@` has changes, otherwise `@-`. It refuses:
#   - nothing to publish (the candidate is empty or already in the bookmark);
#   - an undescribed candidate;
#   - a candidate not on top of the bookmark (rebase first);
#   - a local bookmark that differs from the remote one (fetch first);
#   - `@-` as candidate while `@` holds uncommitted edits;
#   - any change to the working copy or the bookmark while the gate ran.
#
# The gate command is LAND_GATE (default `just check`). --dry-run runs the
# gate and every check, then stops before publishing.
